# ArcoScribeApp Troubleshooting Record

## Background Transfer Issues

### Problem 1: React Native Events Not Dispatched on Main Thread
- **Initial Symptom**: App crashed during background transfers
- **Diagnosis**: Events from native iOS modules were being dispatched on background threads, violating React Native requirements
- **Solution**: Wrapped all `sendEventWithName` calls in delegate methods with `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ ... });` to ensure events are dispatched on the main thread

### Problem 2: NSUserDefaults Crash During Task Persistence
- **Initial Symptom**: App crashed when starting summarization with error: "Attempt to insert non-property list object for key ArcoScribeActiveTasks"
- **Attempted Fix 1**: Replaced `[NSNull null]` with empty strings (`@""`) for nil values - *Partial success*
- **Attempted Fix 2**: Explicitly converted `recordingId` to NSString using `[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", recordingId ?: @""]` - *Still crashed*
- **Root Cause**: Multiple nested issues with property list serialization, race conditions, and unvalidated data
- **Final Comprehensive Solution**:
  1. Created recursive `safePropertyListValue` utility method to validate all values
  2. Added `@synchronized(self)` blocks for thread safety
  3. Implemented pre-validation of dictionaries before storing in NSUserDefaults
  4. Created helper method `safelyStoreActiveTasks` to centralize storage logic
  5. Added error handling and recovery for corrupted data

### Problem 3: API Key Security Issues
- **Initial Symptom**: GitHub blocked push due to exposed API keys in code
- **Attempted Fix**: Replacing API keys with placeholders - *Didn't fix git history issue*
- **Final Solution**:
  1. Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove sensitive files from history
  2. Implemented react-native-dotenv for environment variable management
  3. Created `.env` file for API keys (added to .gitignore)
  4. Updated babel.config.js to support environment variables
  5. Modified service code to import keys from @env

## Implementation Features

### Background Processing Capabilities
- **Feature Implemented**: Full background operation of network tasks
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Configured NSURLSession with background configuration
  2. Set `discretionary = YES` and `sessionSendsLaunchEvents = YES`
  3. Implemented proper task persistence in NSUserDefaults
  4. Created callback handling for system-triggered app launches
  5. Added proper cleanup of temporary files

### Thread Management
- **Feature Implemented**: Thread-safe operation for all native bridge events
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. All React events dispatched on main thread
  2. Used `@synchronized` blocks for thread safety
  3. Added validation before and after data transformations

## Testing & Verification
- **First Success**: Transcription uploads completed after event dispatch fix
- **Second Success**: App built and ran with NSUserDefaults fixes
- **Third Success**: App built with environment variables properly loaded
- **Feature Confirmed**: Tasks continue processing in the background even when app is minimized or device is sleeping
