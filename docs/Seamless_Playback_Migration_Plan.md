# Seamless Playback Migration Plan

> **Goal:** Instant, gapless playback of multi-segment recordings with a single, continuous timeline (Voice-Memos style). All playback now uses an in-memory AVMutableComposition; export to a merged file occurs only for share/upload.

## Phases & Tasks

| ✔ | Task | Layer | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|-------|
| [x] 1. Add `createPlaybackItem` bridge method to **`AudioRecorderModule`** | Native (Obj-C) | iOS | Implemented: builds composition, allocates `AVPlayer`, stores in dictionary, returns **playerId**. |
| [x] 2. Expose `play`, `pause`, `seekTo`, `destroyPlaybackItem` & playback-progress events | Native | iOS | Implemented: methods added, emits `onPlaybackProgress` & `onPlaybackEnded`. |
| [x] 3. Update **`AudioRecordingService.playRecording`** to use new bridge | JS | JS | Implemented: JS uses `createPlaybackItem`, native control. |
| [x] 4. Refactor progress / duration handling | JS | JS | Implemented: UI receives `onPlaybackProgress`; removed manual segment math. |
| [x] 5. Implement `exportCompositionToFile` (background) | Native | iOS | Implemented: background `AVAssetExportSession` with `beginBackgroundTask`. |
| [x] 6. Schedule export after recording finishes | JS | JS | Implemented: JS triggers export; persists path update. |
| [x] 7. Remove lazy `concatenateSegments` path from playback | JS | JS | **Removed all fallback/legacy concat code.** |
| [x] 8. Update **`BackgroundTransferService`** to rely on exported file path | JS | JS | Wait until export resolves; retry if pending. |
| [x] 9. QA: Instant playback test (<= 100 ms) | QA | QA | Multi-segment, 30-min recording on mid-tier device: **PASS** |
| [x] 10. QA: Scrub across segment boundaries | QA | QA | **PASS** (no glitches, correct time ruler) |
| [x] 11. QA: Transcription & share flows | QA | QA | **PASS** (merged file used, no temp-file leaks) |
| [x] 12. Metrics collection hook | JS | JS | **PASS** (time-to-first-audio logs in production) |

## Roll-out & Cleanup
- The feature flag (`USE_COMPOSITION_PLAYBACK`) has been **removed**. Seamless playback is now always enabled.
- All fallback/legacy concatenation code has been **deleted** from the codebase.
- QA confirmed flawless playback, scrubbing, and export on real devices.
- Metrics logging is in place and functional in production builds.

## Rollback Instructions
- If a rollback is ever needed, refer to the git commit immediately before the removal of the flag and fallback logic. (See commit message: "Remove legacy playback fallback and feature flag; seamless playback is now default and only path.")

## Risks / Mitigations
- **Audible gap:** None observed; composition approach is robust. Continue to monitor for rare sample-rate edge cases.
- **Resource leaks:** No leaks detected; `destroyPlaybackItem` is reliably called.
- **Export failure:** No longer relevant for playback; only affects upload/share, which is robust.

## Status
*Updated:* 2025-05-13 23:21 EDT.  
**Migration complete. All code, tests, and QA are finished. Seamless playback is now the only supported path.**

## Summary & Lessons Learned
- **Benefits:**
  - Seamless, instant playback for all recordings (regardless of segment count).
  - No more on-demand concatenation delays or temp file bloat.
  - Simpler, safer, and more maintainable codebase.
  - Metrics and analytics are now easier to collect and interpret.
- **Lessons:**
  - Feature flags are invaluable for safe migrations—remove them promptly after stabilization.
  - Relying on git for rollback is preferable to keeping dead code.
  - Thorough QA (especially on real devices) is critical before deleting fallback logic.
